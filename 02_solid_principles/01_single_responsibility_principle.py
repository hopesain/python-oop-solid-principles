# S on SOLID acronym stands for Single Responsibility Principle (SRP).
# This principle states that a class should have only one reason to change, meaning that a class should only have one job or responsibility.
# In other words, a class should only do one thing and do it well.

# The best way to explain this is through an example.

class BadUserClass:
    def __init__(self, name: str, email: str):
        self.name = name
        self.email = email

    def get_user(self):
        return {"name": self.name, "email": self.email}

    def delete_user(self):
        # Code to delete user
        pass

    def update_user(self, name: str, email: str):
        self.name = name
        self.email = email
    
    def send_email(self, message: str):
        print(f"Sending email to {self.email}: {message}")

    def login(self):
        print(f"{self.name} logged in.")

    def logout(self):
        print(f"{self.name} logged out.")

# This class has multiple responsibilities: managing user data, sending emails, and handling login/logout functionality.

# Now, let's refactor this class to adhere to the Single Responsibility Principle:
class User:
    def __init__(self, username: str, email: str):
        self.username = username
        self.email = email

    def get_user(self):
        return {"username": self.username, "email": self.email}
    
    def update_user(self, new_username: str, new_email: str):
        self.username = new_username
        self.email = new_email
        return f"Updated user: {self.username}, {self.email}"
    

class EmailService:
    def send_welcome_email(self, user: User):
        print(f"Sending welcome email to {user.email} for user {user.username}")



class AuthService:
    def login(self, user: User):
        print(f"{user.username} logged in.")

    def logout(self, user: User):
        print(f"{user.username} logged out.")


# clientCode
user = User("hopesain", "hopesain@email.com")
print(user.get_user())
user.update_user("hope_sain", "HopeSainOfficial@email.com")
print(user.get_user())
print(f"UserClassDict: '{user.__dict__}'")

email = EmailService()
email.send_welcome_email(user)

authentication = AuthService()
authentication.login(user)
authentication.logout(user)

# Another Example.
# Imagine you have a file manager.


class BadFileManager:
    def __init__(self, file_name: str):
        self.file_name = file_name

    def read_file(self):
        print(f"Opening file: '{self.file_name}'")

    def write_file(self):
        print(f"Editing file: '{self.file_name}'")

    def compress_file(self):
        print(f"Compressing file: '{self.file_name}'")

    def decompress_file(self):
        print(f"Decompressing file: '{self.file_name}'")

"""
In the above example, your FileManager class has two different responsibilities. 
It uses the .read() and .write() methods to manage the file. 
It also deals with ZIP archives by providing the .compress() and .decompress() methods.

This class violates the single-responsibility principle because it has two reasons for changing its internal implementation. 
To fix this issue and make your design more robust, you can split the class into two smaller, more focused classes, each with its own specific concern:

class FileManager:
    def __init__(self, file_name: str):
        self.file_name = file_name
    
    def read_file(self):
        print(f"Reading file: '{self.file_name}'")

    def write_file(self):
        print(f"Writing file: '{self.file_name}'")

class ZipFileManager:
    def __init__(self, file_name):
        self.file_name = file_name

        print(f"Compressing file: '{self.file_name}'")

    def decompress_file(self):

# This is now a better implementation, as for the clientCode then I suppose you have to write it yourself, lol. ðŸ˜‚
